=== Makefile
The link:Makefile[] is required for a seamless Eclipse integration.
Most complicated/confusing part is the setup of the ``PATH`` environment variable.
This assures that the MSYS2 toolchain is really used before anything else in the ``$PATH``.

IMPORTANT: ``c:/msys64/usr/bin/make.exe`` must be used as the
"Build command" in "Project Settings/C++ Build" in Eclipse.
Otherwise cmake does not find the toolchain.

NOTE: fun fact: internally cmake will use Ninja because it is faster
and shows less problems compared to make.

=== CMakeLists.txt
This is the root link:CMakeLists.txt[] file.  All other ``CMakeLists.txt``
are included with an invocation of ``add_subdirectory()``.
Unittests are included through the cmake macro ``add_unittest()``.

NOTE: ``add_unittest()`` is not limited to unittesting.  It allows
quick and dirty inclusion of small test projects as well.
