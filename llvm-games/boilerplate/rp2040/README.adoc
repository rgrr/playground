=== Example Project
The example project initializes stdio, prints out a message and does some
LED blinking.  Selected board can be either `pico` or `pico_w`.
Used compiler can be gcc or clang.


=== Configuration
Configuration takes place in the Makefile where `PROJECT`, `PICO_BOARD` and 
`USE_CLANG` can be set.


=== Debugging
For best debugging result, OpenOCD from PlatformIO should be used.  The original
OpenOCD (0.12) has some issues with the dual cores of the RP2040.

Debug configuration in Eclipse thus uses on my machine the OpenOCD path
`~/.platformio/packages/tool-openocd-rp2040-earlephilhower/bin/openocd`
and `-s ~/.platformio/packages/tool-openocd-rp2040-earlephilhower/share/openocd/scripts -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/rp2040.cfg -c "adapter speed 8000"`
in the configuration options.
