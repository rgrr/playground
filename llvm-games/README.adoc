= LLVM games

Here are several things concerning LLVM.

* link:build-llvm[Build LLVM for Embedded Targets]
* link:boilerplate[Boilerplate for Embedded Experiments]
* link:broken-lto[Broken LTO]
* link:profiling[Profiling]
* link:RTT[RTT]

As toolchain I'm using the https://github.com/rgrr/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm[LLVM Embedded Toolchain]
or better my flavor of it, because this one also integrates profiling and RTT.

Probe used is my own based on https://github.com/rgrr/yapicoprobe[picoprobe]
because it supports RTT console IO smoothly.
