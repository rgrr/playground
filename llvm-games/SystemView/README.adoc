=== Aim

Some SystemView experiments.  Trying to integrate it into LLVM Embedded so that it
can be used without headache.


=== SystemView Installation

Installation is a simple download and install from
https://www.segger.com/downloads/systemview/[Segger].


=== Probe Configuration

https://github.com/rgrr/yapicoprobe[YaPicoprobe] supports SystemView out of the box since
v1.15.  IP address of the probe is 192.168.14.1.


=== Test Program on the Target

End result can be found in link:.[main.c].  The test program runs on a Nordic PCA10056 (nRF52840).
Test program includes all the required startup code and linker files, so can be seen as another boiler
plate for development.

Required toolchain is my fork of the
https://github.com/rgrr/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm/tree/feature/contrib-16[LLVM Embedded].


To show the capabilities of SystemView, the following timing diagrams show the difference
between debug and optimized compilation:
