=== Idea
The bootstrapper of BlueConnect needs to do some low power wait on startup to avoid current peaks.
For the low power wait, the watchdog is used in a very early state.

The problem is, that the application is thus invoked always with watchdog set in `RESETREAS`
and thus the application set the "watchdog" flag.

To avoid this, the idea is to use an MCU register to track, if the watchdog
bit was set by the low power wait or by other circumstances.

=== Algorithm

* if `RESETREAS` == 0 (power up!), then set R12 to 0x11223344 and make the low power wait
  with the watchdog (this ends the control flow below)
* else if R12 == 0x11223344, then clear the watchdog bit from `RESETREAS`
  (because it was induced by the above watchdog wait)
* else leave `RESETREAS` as it is
* set R12 to 0
* start application
  

=== Example Project
Write some value to R12 and read it back from R12.
