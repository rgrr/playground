= LTO optimizes code away

Here I'm trying to create a simple example of a `ld.lld` bug happening in
conjuntion with the Nordic SDK:

* there can be several types of  `NRF_SDH_*_OBSERVER` handler
* the (multiple) handler go into special link sections, one section per type
* the link section definitions contain __start/__stop symbols
* during runtime the handlers are called by an iterator
  which calls all handler definitions between the __start/__stop symbols
* empty handler sections are legal

It seems that the LTO transforms the corresponding for-loop of the code into
a do-while-loop, so it works if there is one handler per type, but crashes
if there is no handler definition.
