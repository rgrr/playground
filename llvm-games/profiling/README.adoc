=== Remarks
First compilation trials fail, because `__llvm_profile_runtime` cannot be found.
It seems, that `libclang_rt.profile-*.a` is missing / not built.  One common file
for the compiler and the runtime is `InstrProfData.inc`.


=== Toolchain
https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm[LLVM Embedded Toolchain]
is used.  This includes Picolib which knows semihosting.
