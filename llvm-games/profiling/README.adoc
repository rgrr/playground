=== Remarks
First compilation trials fail, because `__llvm_profile_runtime` cannot be found.
It seems, that `libclang_rt.profile-*.a` is missing / not built.  One common file
for the compiler and the runtime is `InstrProfData.inc`.

It seems that there is no generic approach for `libclang_rt.profile`, so our
own version has to be provided which can be found link:profiling[here]. 


=== XRay
For time based measurements XRay instrumentation could be used, see https://llvm.org/docs/XRay.html


=== Toolchain
https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm[LLVM Embedded Toolchain]
is used.  This includes Picolib which knows semihosting.
