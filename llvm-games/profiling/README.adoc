== Profiling on the Embedded Target

=== Remarks
First compilation trials fail, because `__llvm_profile_runtime` cannot be found.
It seems, that `libclang_rt.profile-*.a` is missing / not built.  One common file
for the compiler and the runtime is `InstrProfData.inc`.

It seems that there is no generic approach for `libclang_rt.profile`, so our
own version has to be provided which can be found link:profiling[here]. 


=== XRay
For time based measurements XRay instrumentation could be used, see https://llvm.org/docs/XRay.html


=== Toolchain
https://github.com/ARM-software/LLVM-embedded-toolchain-for-Arm[LLVM Embedded Toolchain]
is used.  This includes Picolib which knows semihosting.


=== Example
```bash
# compile & run, output must be in default.profraw

~/bin/clang-arm-none-eabi/bin/llvm-profdata merge -sparse default.profraw -o main.profdata

~/bin/clang-arm-none-eabi/bin/llvm-cov show $(find _build/CMakeFiles -iname "*.obj") -instr-profile=main.profdata
```
