=== Aim

Some SystemView experiments.  Trying to integrate it into LLVM Embedded so that it
can be used without headache.

IMPORTANT: SystemView is free for non-commercial use only.


=== Installation
Installation is a simple download and install from
https://www.segger.com/downloads/systemview/[Segger].

NOTE: V3.30 is the last version which allows continuous recording via UART under Debian/Testing.


=== First Steps
For the first steps, SystemViews UART recording is used.  Therefor yapicoprobe
is used as connection to the target which redirects RTT output to a UART.
