=== Aim

Some SystemView experiments.  Trying to integrate it into LLVM Embedded so that it
can be used without headache.

IMPORTANT: SystemView is free for non-commercial use only.


=== Installation

Installation is a simple download and install from
https://www.segger.com/downloads/systemview/[Segger].

NOTE: V3.30 is the last version which allows continuous recording via UART under Debian/Testing,
see https://forum.segger.com/index.php/Thread/8898-Recent-linux-SystemView-version-missing-serial-port-dialog/[Segger forum].


=== Probe Configuration

For the first steps, SystemViews UART recording is used.  Therefor YAPicoprobe
is used as connection to the target which redirects RTT output to a UART.

In the meantime I have integrated TinyUSB RNDIS/ECM/NCM into YAPicoprobe.  This raises some
new compatibility issues, but via CMakeLists.txt the best fitting probe setup can be
chosen.  At least SystemView 3.50a can now be used on Linux.


=== Test Program on the Target

End result can be found in link:.[main.c].

To show the capabilities of SystemView, the following timing diagrams show the difference
between debug and optimized compilation:

=== Another SystemView Issue: SEGGER_RTT_LOCK() [[rtt-lock-problem]]

Introducing SysTick monitoring in the test program revealed some hick ups in the
data sent to SystemView.  Randomly wrong names appeared in the context window
like `ISR 17` or `Timer 0x63`, in the worst case SystemView crashes, see issue also on
https://forum.segger.com/index.php/Thread/9061-SEGGER-RTT-LOCK-UNLOCK-code-wrong/[Segger forum].

Solution was TMO wrong lock code in `SEGGER_RTT_LOCK()` / `SEGGER_RTT_UNLOCK()`.
Replacing it with the following experimental code fragment solves the issue (for me):
