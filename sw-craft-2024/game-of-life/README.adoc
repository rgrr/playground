= Game of Life

== Introduction
This are some link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life[Game of Life]
implementations.

The field is organized as a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus[torus]. 

== Algorithms

=== TLife
Stupid algorithm which uses a field of boolean (alive/dead, actually ints) 
and counts the neighbors for each cell.

=== TLifeFaster
Less stupid algorithm which uses two fields.  One field is holding the boolean
state of the cells (alive/dead), the other holds the neighbor count of each cell.

=== TLifeFasterMulti
Like `TLifeFaster`, but multi-threaded.

This version does actually not scale very good.  Reasons are under "investigation".
E.g. Changing `TLifeCell` from `uint32_t` to `uint8_t` led to much better results, so
cache trashing is perhaps an issue.

== Testing
Change the used generator via link:TLife_Tests.cpp[].
