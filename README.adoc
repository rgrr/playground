This is mailto:reinhard.griech@endress.com[Hardy's, Playground on egit] personal playground.

Everyone is free to contribute.


== Setup
=== C/C++
For C/C++ experiments most of the time https://eclipse.org[Eclipse] is used as IDE.
Toolchain etc is taken from https://www.msys2.org/[MSYS2].

==== MSYS2
Because my software is most of the time running on 32bit targets, MINGW32 packets are used for playing and testing.

More information can be found in https://clue.endress.com/x/SetHD[Clue].

NOTE: MSYS2 installation should go to the default location ``c:\msys64``.
